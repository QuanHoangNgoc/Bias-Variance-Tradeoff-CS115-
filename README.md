### About

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: This assignment delves into the intricate balance between bias and variance in predictive modeling.
- **Conceptual Mastery**: I gained a deep understanding of the [Bias-Variance Concept] and its implications when fitting and evaluating a hypothesis.
- **Experimental Insights**: Through hands-on experiments, I explored the effects of varying 'sample size' and 'hypothesis degree' on bias and variance, unraveling the delicate interplay between these critical factors.
